This repo contains a script to set up the safe environment for exploitation and a script that is responsible for carrying out the exploitation stages of:
# CVE-2024-3400

# Palo Alto Firewall Test Environment

This repository provides a shell script that allows you to quickly set up a test environment for the Palo Alto firewall with the necessary configuration to test an exploit.

## Requirements

- Docker installed on your system.
- Internet connection to download the Palo Alto firewall container image.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/paloalto-test-environment.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd paloalto-test-environment
```

3. Run the shell script to configure the environment:

```bash
./configure_environment.sh
```

This script will perform the following actions:

- Create a Docker network for the environment.
- Run a container for the Palo Alto firewall.
- Configure firewall rules.
- Set up network segmentation.
- Implement authentication and authorization.
- Configure the intrusion detection system.
- Monitor and audit network traffic.
- Display information about the firewall version and status.

Note: Make sure to run the script with superuser privileges or execute permission.

## Additional Notes

- The script may take a few minutes to complete as it downloads the Palo Alto firewall container image and performs the necessary configurations.
- Once the environment is set up, you can use the `exploit.py` script to test an exploit on the Palo Alto firewall. Make sure to provide the firewall's IP address as an argument to the script.
